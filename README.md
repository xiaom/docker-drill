**NOTES:** The document is outdated and need to be update later. We did not follow the best practice of docker container and use it a VMs. The plan is to clean it up in next iteration.

# Build the image

```
docker build -t xiaom/drill .
```

# Create a container (run an image)

```
# docker run --name [container name] -p [port to access:port exposed] -i -t [memcached image name]
#	-v, -volume=[]            Bind mount a volume (e.g., from the host: -v /host:/container, from docker: -v /container)
#	-h, --hostname=""          Container host name
#	-P, --publish-all=false    Publish all exposed ports to the host interfaces
docker run --name zoo1 -h zoo1 -dns 172.17.42.1 -P xiaom/drill
```

# Service Discovery and DNS server

This is the most important one.

## Poor Man's DNS Solution

Simply use current host as the DNS server

```
# /etc/dnsmasq.conf
listen-address=0.0.0.0
interface=lo
interface=eth0
interface=docker0
resolv-file=/etc/resolv.dnsmasq.conf
conf-dir=/opt/docker/dnsmasq.d         # <== Here !
```

dns

```
$ container='db'
$ new_ip=$(docker inspect $container | grep IPAddress | cut -f4 -d'"')
$ echo "host-record=$container,$new_ip" > /opt/docker/dnsmasq.d/0host_$container
$ service dnsmasq restart
```
